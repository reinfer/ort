title: Platform support
description: `ort` supports a wide variety of platforms. For most desktop users, pre-built binaries are available, so setting up `ort` is as simple as adding it to your `Cargo.toml`!

# Platform compatibility with ONNX Runtime

Here are the supported platforms and binary availability status, as of v2.0.0-rc.9.

* 🟢 - Supported. Binaries provided by pyke.
* 🔷 - Supported. Precompiled binaries not available.
* ❌ - Not supported.

| Platform | x86 | x86-64 | ARMv7 | ARM64 |

<div style={{ opacity: 0.5, display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', fontSize: '0.75rem' }}>
<p>\* A recent version of Windows 10/11 & Visual Studio 2022 (≥ 17.11) are required for pyke binaries.</p>
<p>† glibc ≥ 2.35 & libstdc++ >= 12 (Ubuntu ≥ 22.04) required for pyke binaries.</p>
<p>§ macOS ≥ 10.15 required.</p>
</div>

If your platform is marked as 🟢, you're in luck! Almost no setup will be required to get `ort` up and running.

For platforms marked as 🔷, you'll need to [compile ONNX Runtime from source](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/) and then [link `ort` to your custom binaries](/setup/linking) (but don't worry, we made this setup as simple as possible too!)

<Callout type='info'>
    Certain execution providers may not have binaries available. You can check EP binary support in the [Execution providers](/perf/execution-providers) documentation.

## Alternative backends & WebAssembly
`ort`'s [alternative backends](/backends) typically have far more lax platform requirements. If you're looking to deploy your application to WASM, or a platform not supported by ONNX Runtime, it's worth giving one of them a shot!
