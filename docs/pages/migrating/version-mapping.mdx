## A note on SemVer
`ort` versions pre-2.0 were not SemVer compatible. From v2.0 onwards, breaking API changes are accompanied by a **major version update**.

Updates to the version of ONNX Runtime used by `ort` may occur on **minor** version updates, i.e. 2.0 ships with ONNX Runtime 1.20.2, but 2.1 may ship with 1.21.0. ONNX Runtime is generally forward compatible, but in case you require a specific version of ONNX Runtime, you should pin the minor version in your `Cargo.toml` using a [tilde requirement](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#tilde-requirements):
```toml
[dependencies]
ort = { version = "~2.0", ... }
```
