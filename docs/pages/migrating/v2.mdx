title: Migrating from v1.x to v2
description: Here's what you need to know to update your application to use the latest & greatest version of ort.
---

## `Environment` no more
The `Environment` struct has been removed. Only one `Environment` was allowed per process, so it didn't really make sense to have an environment as a struct.

To configure an `Environment`, you instead use the `ort::init` function, which returns the same `EnvironmentBuilder` as v1.x. Use `commit()` to then commit the environment.

```rust
ort::init()
    .with_execution_providers([CUDAExecutionProvider::default().build()])
    .commit()?;
```

`commit()` must be called before any sessions are created to take effect. Otherwise, a default environment will be created. The global environment can be updated afterward by calling `commit()` on another `EnvironmentBuilder`, however you'll need to recreate sessions after comitting the new environment in order for them to use it.

## Value specialization
The `Value` struct has been refactored into multiple strongly-typed structs: `Tensor<T>`, `Map<K, V>`, and `Sequence<T>`, and their type-erased variants: `DynTensor`, `DynMap`, and `DynSequence`.

Values returned by session inference are now `DynValue`s, which behave exactly the same as `Value` in previous versions.

Tensors created from Rust, like via the new `Tensor::new` function, can be directly and infallibly extracted into its underlying data via `extract_tensor` (no `try_`):
```rust
let allocator = Allocator::new(&session, MemoryInfo::new(AllocationDevice::CUDA_PINNED, 0, AllocatorType::Device, MemoryType::CPUInput)?)?;
let tensor = Tensor::<f32>::new(&allocator, [1, 128, 128, 3])?;

let array = tensor.extract_array();
// no need to specify type or handle errors - Tensor<f32> can only extract into an f32 ArrayView
```

You can still extract tensors, maps, or sequence values normally from a `DynValue` using `try_extract_*`:
```rust
let generated_tokens: ArrayViewD<f32> = outputs["output1"].try_extract_tensor()?;
```

`DynValue` can be `downcast()`ed to the more specialized types, like `DynMap` or `Tensor<T>`:
```rust
let tensor: Tensor<f32> = value.downcast()?;
let map: DynMap = value.downcast()?;
```

Similarly, a strongly-typed value like `Tensor<T>` can be upcast back into a `DynValue` or `DynTensor`.
```rust
let dyn_tensor: DynTensor = tensor.upcast();
let dyn_value: DynValue = tensor.into_dyn();
```

### Tensor extraction directly returns an `ArrayView`
The new `extract_tensor` and `try_extract_tensor` functions return an `ndarray::ArrayView` directly, instead of putting it behind the old `ort::value::Tensor<T>` type (not to be confused with the new specialized value type). This means you don't have to `.view()` on the result:
```diff
-let generated_tokens: Tensor<f32> = outputs["output1"].try_extract()?;
-let generated_tokens = generated_tokens.view();
+let generated_tokens: ArrayViewD<f32> = outputs["output1"].try_extract_tensor()?;
```

### Full support for sequence & map values
You can now construct and extract `Sequence`/`Map` values.

### Value views
You can now obtain a view of any `Value` via the new `view()` and `view_mut()` functions, which operate similar to `ndarray`'s own view system. These views can also now be passed into session inputs.

### Mutable tensor extraction
You can extract a mutable `ArrayViewMut` or `&mut [T]` from a mutable reference to a tensor.
```rust
let (raw_shape, raw_data) = tensor.extract_raw_tensor_mut();
```

### Device-allocated tensors
You can now create a tensor on device memory with `Tensor::new` & an allocator:

```rust
let allocator = Allocator::new(&session, MemoryInfo::new(AllocationDevice::CUDA_PINNED, 0, AllocatorType::Device, MemoryType::CPUInput)?)?;
let tensor = Tensor::<f32>::new(&allocator, [1, 128, 128, 3])?;
```

The data will be allocated by the device specified by the allocator. You can then use the new mutable tensor extraction to modify the tensor's data.

## Session creation
`SessionBuilder::new(&environment)` has been soft-replaced with `Session::builder()`:

```diff
-// v1.x
-let session = SessionBuilder::new(&environment)?.with_model_from_file("model.onnx")?;
+// v2
+let session = Session::builder()?.commit_from_file("model.onnx")?;
```

### `SessionBuilder::with_model_*` -> `SessionBuilder::commit_*`
The final `SessionBuilder` methods have been renamed for clarity.

- `SessionBuilder::with_model_from_file` -> `SessionBuilder::commit_from_file`
- `SessionBuilder::with_model_from_memory` -> `SessionBuilder::commit_from_memory`
- `SessionBuilder::with_model_from_memory_directly` -> `SessionBuilder::commit_from_memory_directly`
- `SessionBuilder::with_model_downloaded` -> `SessionBuilder::commit_from_url`

## Session inputs

### Tensor creation
You can now create input tensors from `Array`s and `ArrayView`s. See the [tensor value documentation](/fundamentals/value#creating-values) for more information.

### `ort::inputs!` macro

v2.0 makes the transition to the new input/output system easier by providing an `inputs!` macro. This new macro allows you to specify inputs either by position as they appear in the graph (like previous versions), or by name.

The `ort::inputs!` macro will painlessly convert compatible data types (see above) into the new inputs system.

```diff
-// v1.x
-let chunk_embeddings = text_encoder.run(&[CowArray::from(text_input_chunk.into_dyn())])?;
+// v2
+let chunk_embeddings = text_encoder.run(ort::inputs![text_input_chunk])?;
```

As mentioned, you can now also specify inputs by name using a map-like syntax. This is especially useful for graphs with optional inputs.
```rust
let noise_pred = unet.run(ort::inputs![
    "latents" => &latents,
    "timestep" => Tensor::from_array(([1], vec![t]))?,
    "encoder_hidden_states" => text_embeddings.view()
])?;
```

### Tensor creation no longer requires the session's allocator
In previous versions, `Value::from_array` took an allocator parameter. The allocator was only used because the string data contained in string tensors had to be cloned into ONNX Runtime-managed memory. However, 99% of users only ever use primitive tensors, so the extra parameter served little purpose. The new `Tensor::from_array` function now takes only an array, and the logic for converting string arrays has been moved to a new function, `DynTensor::from_string_array`.

```diff
-// v1.x
-let val = Value::from_array(session.allocator(), &array)?;
+// v2
+let val = Tensor::from_array(array)?;
```

### Separate string tensor creation
As previously mentioned, the logic for creating string tensors has been moved from `Value::from_array` to `DynTensor::from_string_array`.

To use string tensors with `ort::inputs!`, you must create a `Tensor` using `Tensor::from_string_array`.

```rust
let array = ndarray::Array::from_shape_vec((1,), vec![document]).unwrap();
let outputs = session.run(ort::inputs![
    "input" => Tensor::from_string_array(session.allocator(), array)?
])?;
```

## Session outputs

### New: Retrieve outputs by name
Just like how inputs can now be specified by name, you can now retrieve session outputs by name.

```rust
let l = outputs["latents"].try_extract_tensor::<f32>()?;
```

## Execution providers
Execution provider structs with public fields have been replaced with builder pattern structs. See the [API reference](https://docs.rs/ort/2.0.0-rc.9/ort/execution_providers/index.html#reexports) and the [execution providers reference](/perf/execution-providers) for more information.

```diff
-// v1.x
-builder = builder.with_execution_providers(ExecutionProvider::DirectML(DirectMLExecutionProvider {
-    device_id: 1
-}))?;
+// v2
+builder = builder.with_execution_providers([
+    DirectMLExecutionProvider::default()
+        .with_device_id(1)
+        .build()
+])?;
```

## Updated dependencies & features

### `ndarray` 0.16
The `ndarray` dependency has been upgraded to 0.16. In order to convert tensors from `ndarray`, your application must update to `ndarray` 0.16 as well.

### `ndarray` is now optional
The dependency on `ndarray` is now optional. If you previously used `ort` with `default-features = false`, you'll need to add the `ndarray` feature to keep using `ndarray` integration.

## Model Zoo structs have been removed
ONNX pushed a new Model Zoo structure that adds hundreds of different models. This is impractical to maintain, so the built-in structs have been removed.

You can still use `Session::commit_from_url`, it just now takes a URL string instead of a struct.

## Changes to logging
Environment-level logging configuration (i.e. `EnvironmentBuilder::with_log_level`) has been removed because it could cause unnecessary confusion with our `tracing` integration.

## Renamed types
The following types have been renamed with no other changes.
- `NdArrayExtensions` -> `ArrayExtensions`
- `OrtResult`, `OrtError` -> `ort::Result`, `ort::Error`
- `TensorDataToType` -> `ExtractTensorData`
- `TensorElementDataType`, `IntoTensorElementDataType` -> `TensorElementType`, `IntoTensorElementType`
